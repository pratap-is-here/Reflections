Q 1-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When there there are many people working on the same project.

Q 2-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

because we do not want all the changes done on github to come down to our local repository.

Q 3-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork a repository to have a copy of it in my github profile.
it is used when i want to make changes in someone else's repo and keep the edited version to myself.

clone is used to download a copy of a repo from one computer or url to another.
used when we we want to download a copy of a repo on our computer to edit it

branches are used to experiment on new features or to remove a bug without affect the production quality.
